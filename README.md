This is my game, Pong Pt. 2.

To start, you hit the space bar

Hitting C or X will rotate through a predetermined set of random colors for the ball

The W and S keys control the Blue Paddle
The Up and Down arrows control the Red Paddle

When the ball hits the scoring wall behind either paddle, the score at the top will track it up to 5 points
